### Thread 1, Day 9 - Tuesday, October 31, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Discussion: [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
	- Solving logical errors and syntax errors can be frustrating, but everyone deals with it, even experienced programmers.
	- Pairing with a friend to describe what you are trying to do with your code, line by line, can be helpful.
		- Often during this process, you will realize the source of the problem you are having.
	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! ðŸ¦†
2. Activity: Building a Create Task Exemplar
	- Finishing [[Media/Spelling\|an app]] that meets requirements for the AP CSP Create Task.
		> [!TIP]
		> You can [view the history of commits](https://github.com/russellgordon/Spelling/commits/main) here.
		> 
		> You can click the links at right for a given commit to see changes made for that step:
		> 
		> ![Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 4.50.25â€¯PM.png|600](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-10-30%20at%204.50.25%E2%80%AFPM.png)
		> 
		> Have a look at the changes for each commit and that should help you understand how the app was developed.
3. Activity: Authoring Create Task Responses
	- Here are [requirements given for this year's Create Task](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf).
	- Here are [last year's writing prompts](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/AP_Create_Task_2022-23_-_Submission_Requirements.pdf#page=3).
	- We will work together to develop good responses to the prompts.
###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] No new homework. Enjoy the spooky evening! ðŸ‘» ðŸŽƒ

### Thread 1, Day 8 - Monday, October 30, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Activity: Building a Create Task Exemplar
	- We will [[Media/Spelling\|build an app]] that meets requirements for the AP CSP Create Task.
		- The app's audience is elementary school students.
		- It's beneficial effect, or purpose, is to help young children to spell and to accurately identify food items.
		- [Fork and clone this repository](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/Spelling) to get started with developing the app.
		> [!NOTE]
		> If you were absent for today's class, you can [view the history of commits](https://github.com/russellgordon/Spelling/commits/main) made as we developed the app today in class.
		> 
		> You can click the links at right for a given commit to see changes made for that step:
		> 
		> ![Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 4.50.25â€¯PM.png|600](/img/user/Media/Screenshot%202023-10-30%20at%204.50.25%E2%80%AFPM.png)
		> 
		> Have a look at the changes for each commit and that should help you understand how the app was developed.
	- Compare the completed app to the [requirements given for this year's Create Task](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf).
	- Begin generating responses to [last year's prompts](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/AP_Create_Task_2022-23_-_Submission_Requirements.pdf#page=3).
###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Do your best to author rough written responses to [the prompts for last year's AP CSP Create Task](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/AP_Create_Task_2022-23_-_Submission_Requirements.pdf#page=3) based on [the exemplar built today](https://github.com/russellgordon/Spelling/commits/main).
	- We will then discuss and compare responses in our class tomorrow morning.

### Thread 1, Day 6 - Thursday, October 26, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Warmup: Defining Custom Shapes
	- Revisit your understanding of how to define custom shapes.
	- Attempt to define a path in the `Arrow` struct so that you can [[Media/Rotating Arrow\|have an app that has this functionality]].
	- First create a new Xcode project named **Rotating Arrow**.
	- Then you can [use this code to get started](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/a81ee78143d2680624f4f6d751068968) â€“ all you need to do is fill in the `Arrow` structure's `path` function.
2. Activity: Generative Art (SwiftUI) â€“Â Part 2 of 3
	- More progress on our [[Images/Introduction to Generative Art\|implementation of these rules]] using SwiftUI.
3. Exercise: Create a "Bento-Box" Layout
	- Marketing teams must be able to convey new features in a concise manner to an audience.
	- In recent years, Apple has used "Bento-Box" graphics to do so.
	- Try to [[Media/Bento Box Example\|reproduce this image]] using SwiftUI, or use it as inspiration to design a bento-box themed view related to something you care about.
	- Use SwiftUI Views Mastery as a reference.
	  > [!HINT]
	  > Some keywords to look for examples of:
	  > - foregroundStyle
	  > - cornerRadius
	  > - gradient
	  > - Image
	  >   
	  > **Also:** the keyboard shortcut `Option-Shift-K` produces the Apple logo.

5. Distribute Course Materials
	- Please sign the form being distributed to authorize charges to your family's account at LCS for required reference books.
6. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Creating a Notion Account\|Creating a Notion Account]]

	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! 🦆
2. Activity: Building a Create Task Exemplar
	- Finishing [[Media/Spelling\|an app]] that meets requirements for the AP CSP Create Task.
		> [!TIP]
		> You can [view the history of commits](https://github.com/russellgordon/Spelling/commits/main) here.
		> 
		> You can click the links at right for a given commit to see changes made for that step:

		> 
		> Have a look at the changes for each commit and that should help you understand how the app was developed.
3. Activity: Authoring Create Task Responses
	- Here are [requirements given for this year's Create Task](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf).

### Thread 1, Day 6 - Thursday, October 26, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Warmup: Defining Custom Shapes
	- Revisit your understanding of how to define custom shapes.
	- Attempt to define a path in the `Arrow` struct so that you can [[Media/Rotating Arrow\|have an app that has this functionality]].
	- First create a new Xcode project named **Rotating Arrow**.
	- Then you can [use this code to get started](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/a81ee78143d2680624f4f6d751068968) – all you need to do is fill in the `Arrow` structure's `path` function.
2. Activity: Generative Art (SwiftUI) – Part 2 of 3
	- More progress on our [[Images/Introduction to Generative Art\|implementation of these rules]] using SwiftUI.
3. Exercise: Create a "Bento-Box" Layout
	- Marketing teams must be able to convey new features in a concise manner to an audience.
	- In recent years, Apple has used "Bento-Box" graphics to do so.
	- Try to [[Media/Bento Box Example\|reproduce this image]] using SwiftUI, or use it as inspiration to design a bento-box themed view related to something you care about.
	- Use SwiftUI Views Mastery as a reference.
	  > [!HINT]
	  > Some keywords to look for examples of:
	  > - foregroundStyle
	  > - cornerRadius
	  > - gradient
	  > - Image
	  >   
	  > **Also:** the keyboard shortcut `Option-Shift-K` produces the Apple logo.

### Thread 1, Day 3 - Thursday, October 19, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Activity: Generative Art
	- As a vehicle to review key topics from prior courses, we'll briefly explore generative art.
	- First, [[Images/Introduction to Generative Art\|on paper]], then, by looking at several ways to [implement this in code](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/Animation.zip).

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Work on your implementation of the generative art algorithm.

### Thread 1, Day 2 - Wednesday, October 18, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Source Control: GitHub Account
	- If necessary, creating an account
	- Setting up a new access token
1. Source Control: [Ignored Files](https://www.russellgordon.ca/gitignore-setup.txt)
	- Some Xcode setup to ensure files that should not go under source control are ignored.
1. Xcode: Creating a Command-Line Project
1. Activity: Implementing a Sort Algorithm 
	- Here is an [improved version of the code](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/5f492f078dc3293f116b0ca5cfe103a4) we developed together in class.
	- This can be copy-pasted into your playground, as needed.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Do your best to finish implementing your sorting algorithm.
	- Post [on Notion](https://notion.so) to share your progress, regardless of whether you were able to successfully finish the task.

### Thread 1, Day 1 - Tuesday, October 17, 2023
#### Agenda
1. [Update Operating System](https://teaching.russellgordon.ca/software-setup/mac-os-sonoma/)
	- Update your computer to macOS Sonoma if you have not done so already.
2. Install [[Setup/Xcodes\|Xcodes]]
	- If you do not have this application installed just yet, please install it now.
	- The app makes it easier to manage installation of Xcode versions.
3. Install Xcode 15
	- Use Xcodes to install Xcode 15.
	  > [!TIP]
	  > Do not install Xcode via the App Store, as using this method means that it will automatically get upgraded when a new version is released (which is not always ideal).
4. [Course Outline](https://bit.ly/lcscs23-g12-sco)
5. Distribute Course Materials
	- Please sign the form being distributed to authorize charges to your family's account at LCS for required reference books.
6. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Creating a Notion Account\|Creating a Notion Account]]
	- Please create a bookmark for your portfolio page in Notion.
7. Activity: Developing a Sorting Algorithm
###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Install required software as described above.
- [ ] Be sure you and your partner(s) have posted your sorting algorithm video to your portfolio [in Notion](https://notion.so).

### Thread 1, Day 5 - Tuesday, October 24, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Activity: Generative Art (SwiftUI)
	- How can we [[Images/Introduction to Generative Art\|implement these rules]] using SwiftUI?
###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Spend time on tasks as needed to demonstrate your understanding of tasks we have recently looked at:
	- sorting algorithms (operations with lists of data)
	- generative art (working with control structures)
	- Magic 8 Ball (building interfaces and using lists in SwiftUI)
	- generative art (in SwiftUI)

### Thread 1, Day 4 - Monday, October 23, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Sharing Long Blocks of Code\|Sharing Long Blocks of Code]]
	- Share code, not screenshots of code.
	- Please continue to use screenshots to show the *results* of code being run.
1. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Handling Comments on Posts\|Handling Comments on Posts]]
	- Do not mark comments as resolved in Notion so that the record of our conversation is preserved and easy to see at a glance.
1. Discussion: Productive Use of Generative AI
	- Looking at an example of when we might use a large language model to advance learning in this course.
1. Discussion: How to Obtain Your Electronic Textbooks
	- How to get your copies of *SwiftUI Views Mastery* and *Working with Data in SwiftUI*
2. Activity: [[Activities/Implementing a Sorting Algorithm\|Implementing a Sorting Algorithm]]
	- Complete this activity to solidify your understanding of core programming concepts (loops and selection statements) and begin to build your understanding of sorting algorithms.
	- Be sure to make a portfolio post on [Notion](https://notion.so) after completing the activity.
3. Activity: [[Activities/Magic 8 Ball\|Magic 8 Ball]] 
	-  Complete this activity to review the implementation of a simple user interface using SwiftUI.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Spend time on tasks as needed to demonstrate your understanding of tasks we have recently looked at:
	- sorting algorithms (operations with lists of data)
	- generative art (working with control structures)
	- Magic 8 Ball (building interfaces and using lists in SwiftUI)

### Thread 1, Day 3 - Thursday, October 19, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Activity: Generative Art
	- As a vehicle to review key topics from prior courses, we'll briefly explore generative art.
	- First, [[Images/Introduction to Generative Art\|on paper]], then, by looking at several ways to [implement this in code](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/Animation.zip).

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Work on your implementation of the generative art algorithm.

### Thread 1, Day 2 - Wednesday, October 18, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Source Control: GitHub Account
	- If necessary, creating an account
	- Setting up a new access token
1. Source Control: [Ignored Files](https://www.russellgordon.ca/gitignore-setup.txt)
	- Some Xcode setup to ensure files that should not go under source control are ignored.
1. Xcode: Creating a Command-Line Project
1. Activity: Implementing a Sort Algorithm 
	- Here is an [improved version of the code](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/5f492f078dc3293f116b0ca5cfe103a4) we developed together in class.
	- This can be copy-pasted into your playground, as needed.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Do your best to finish implementing your sorting algorithm.
	- Post [on Notion](https://notion.so) to share your progress, regardless of whether you were able to successfully finish the task.

### Thread 1, Day 1 - Tuesday, October 17, 2023
#### Agenda
1. [Update Operating System](https://teaching.russellgordon.ca/software-setup/mac-os-sonoma/)
	- Update your computer to macOS Sonoma if you have not done so already.
2. Install [[Setup/Xcodes\|Xcodes]]
	- If you do not have this application installed just yet, please install it now.
	- The app makes it easier to manage installation of Xcode versions.
3. Install Xcode 15
	- Use Xcodes to install Xcode 15.
	  > [!TIP]
	  > Do not install Xcode via the App Store, as using this method means that it will automatically get upgraded when a new version is released (which is not always ideal).
4. [Course Outline](https://bit.ly/lcscs23-g12-sco)
5. Distribute Course Materials
	- Please sign the form being distributed to authorize charges to your family's account at LCS for required reference books.
6. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Creating a Notion Account\|Creating a Notion Account]]
	- Please create a bookmark for your portfolio page in Notion.
7. Activity: Developing a Sorting Algorithm
###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Install required software as described above.
- [ ] Be sure you and your partner(s) have posted your sorting algorithm video to your portfolio [in Notion](https://notion.so).

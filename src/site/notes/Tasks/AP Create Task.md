# AP Create Task 

## Exemplar

Multiplication Maestro is another MVP (minimum viable product) for the AP Create Task.

1. Watch the [53 second video demo of Multiplication Maestro](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2021-22/MultiplicationMaestro/).
2. Familiarize yourself with the source code [by reviewing commits step by step](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2021-22/MultiplicationMaestro/commits/).
	-  Here is the [list of commits for Multiplication Maestro](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/MultiplicationMaestro/commits/main).
    -  Green segments reflect code that was added in a given commit.
    -  Red segments reflect code that was removed.
4. [Clone the exemplar project](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/MultiplicationMaestro) and try it out.
    - Note the following:
        1. Code is written to be as simple to understand as possible. 
            - You can likely think of better ways to organize the code...
        2. Results are filtered [using an approach that is](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/MultiplicationMaestro/blob/8d20826a2c5db8e0ea06a941d9438384ca65891b/MultiplicationMaestro/Views/ContentView.swift#L219-L246):
            - designed to meet AP Create Task requirements
            - not the way you would filter a list "in real life" when writing an app using Swift and SwiftUI
5. Watch [this video that explains Create Task requirements and how the exemplar meets them](https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=xNn6gU_gvRo).
    - For the exemplar, here is: 
        - The [complete program code](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/ap-create-task-program-code.pdf) as a PDF file
        - The [1-minute video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18REb5dUpQzt7bMegkwxZNVyBzAqMWAgR/view)
        - The [written responses](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/written-responses-with-program-code.pdf), which this year, you will write on the exam itself on ==Wednesday, May 15, 2024 at 12 noon==.

## Requirements

1. Read this one-page summary of the [2024 AP Create Task general requirements](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf#page=3).
2. Review the [detailed 2024 AP Create Task requirements](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf#page=4).
3. Understand the [2023 AP Create Task rubric](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/ap-create-task-scoring-guidelines.pdf).
    - These are the guidelines that the College Board evaluator will likely use to score the responses that you author in May on the exam.
    - To better understand requirements, again, you may watch [this video that compares the exemplar to the rubric](https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=xNn6gU_gvRo).

## Getting Started
1. Make a plan for your project.
    - While not formally required, paper prototypes may help organize your thoughts.
2. Author your program code – _source control must be used_.
    - Create your project in Xcode.
    - Create a remote.
    - Commit and push your code regularly, using [descriptive commit messages](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/MultiplicationMaestro/commits/main).
3. Test your code thoroughly and be certain to leave enough time to:
    1. Print your code to PDF.
	    - Here is how to do it in less than 5 minutes.
	        1. [Download, install, and open BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com).
	        2. Complete these steps – follow the links to see a video demo:
			- 00:00 - [Open Xcode and BBEdit side-by-side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=0s)
			- 00:06 - [Copy and paste each file into BBEdit, removing your name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=6s)
			- 01:23 - [Save the file in BBEdit with `.swift` as the file extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=83s)
			- 01:48 - [Print the document with line numbers and syntax highlighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=108s)
			- 02:31 - [Optionally print the document in landscape mode to show longer lines better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=151s)
    2. Record your [1-minute video](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf#page=5).
        - The easiest way to record a video is to press `Command-R` when your app is running in the Simulator.
        - Here is [how to "make small text large"](https://www.russellgordon.ca/tips/embiggen-text-like-a-pro/) if you wish to use this effect in your video.
          
        > [!NOTE]
        > It is not required to show text captions within your video, although it is encouraged *if you have the time* as it makes the College Board evaluator's job easier. If you choose to do this, [use Quicktime Player](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/quicktime-player/qtp97b08e666/10.5/mac/12.0) to record your video.
        
    3. Author your written responses to the [probable exam questions](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/AP_Create_Task_2022-23_-_Submission_Requirements.pdf#page=3).
	    - Be sure that code screenshots are legible – code cannot be so tiny that it becomes nearly impossible to read without a magnifying glass.
	    - Although you are not submitting your written responses now, you can keep these to refer to prior to the exam in May.
	    - ==It is recommended that you take screenshots for your written responses from the PDF you created using BBEdit, so that line numbers match up with the PDF file you are providing with your full program code.==
		    - If you instead take code screenshots from Xcode directly, line numbers will not match up with your full program code PDF, which could be confusing for the College Board evaluator who reviews your submission.
	      
4. When you are all finished, [submit your work to the College Board](https://digitalportfolio.collegeboard.org/).

## Final Notes

- All class periods after today leading up and including the firm deadline of ==Tuesday November 14, 2023== will be working periods for you to complete this task.
	- If you finish all or part of your AP Create Task in advance of our next module, you may use our class time in any way that you see fit, but you must be present in class, and of course, respectful of your peers' need to focus on completing their own work.
- Each day, at the end of class time, make a [brief post on Notion](https://notion.so) to share an update on your progress and to ask clarifying questions.

# Magic 8 Ball

## Introduction

Here is a [video demonstrating the use of a Magic 8 Ball](https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSaS17CSS4c), and here is a [detailed written description of the classic responses](https://magic-8ball.com/magic-8-ball-answers/) given by this mysterious and mystical device.

## Command-line project

Here is the [code for a complete command-line implementation](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/3588cb46eb27b0354fa212ca065371ba) of a Magic 8 Ball.

Create a new [[Tutorials/Creating a Command-Line Project\|command-line project]] in Xcode, copy in the code provided above, and try it out.

## iOS App

Use what you remember from last year to create an app with user interface for a phone-based version of a Magic 8 Ball:

After the user gets advice, the information should be added to a scrollable list:

If you need a refresher on some topics, use these resources:

- [Taking action when a user provides text-based input](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-take-action-when-the-user-submits-a-textfield)
	- NOTE: This is even easier in iOS 17.

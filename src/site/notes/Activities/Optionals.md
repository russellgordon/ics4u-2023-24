# Optionals

## Introduction

You already understand how to use typical data types such as `Int`, `Double`, `String`, and `Bool`.

You have built applications that accept user input as a `Double` via the `Slider` structure in SwiftUI.

Sliders prevent the user from providing invalid input. This is *very* helpful, however, it can be hard to select a precise value.

Sometimes, it would be preferable to accept "free form" or typed input from the user. What happens, though, when invalid input is received from a user? For example, our app might expect numeric input – but the user could type `fifty` rather than `50`.

This is when the notion of an *optional* data type becomes useful.

Try each page of the playground by following instructions given, while taking notes in your black paper notebook.

Take your time – *read for understanding* – write down your responses to the questions posed in your black book.

When you are done – *summarize* in writing what you have learned in your [Notion post](https://notion.so) for today – as well as any questions you have.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to include several screenshots showing your progress as you completed the playground.

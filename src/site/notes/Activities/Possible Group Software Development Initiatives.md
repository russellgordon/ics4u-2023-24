# Possible Group Software Development Initiatives

## Introduction

When inspiration strikes, make notes.

The following is a list of potential app ideas that could be built out if we can find an audience to interview for feature development and prioritization.

## List of potential apps

In no particular order...

### Wallpaper Maker

Allow the user to create and select gradients, then save and set wallpaper on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, or some combination thereof.

### Pet Feeding Tracker

*Has the dog been fed?*

Constant question in Mr. Gordon's household.

A way to set a schedule and for a family to log when the dog has been fed. Would require cloud syncing (Firebase?) to work.

### Transformations of Functions Tutor

It pains Mr. Gordon to see students struggling with this concept which is a core part of grade 11 math.

Years ago he wrote a file that works on Nspire calculators that would generate practice questions and teach students in a visual manner how to transform functions.

This would be great if transitioned to a more modern device such as an iPad or iPhone.

### Talking Forest

Ms. Dalrymple's idea – a way to tell the story of the Northcote and main LCS campuses through walking.

Involves using geo-fencing to activate content within an app based on where a person (or more accurately, their phone) is located.

Here is the [3-minute video shared in class](https://globalnews.ca/video/8493730/the-talking-forest-hear-stories-from-the-trees-in-lindsay-ont) and a [written overview of the app](https://www.kawarthaconservation.com/en/learn-and-get-involved/the-talking-forest.aspx) as authored for a conservation area in the Lindsay area.

### Lakefield History

Mr. Michael Chappell from the LCS community is looking for an app to be a self-guided exploration of historic parts of Lakefield.

Not entirely dissimilar from the *Talking Forest* app described above.

### School Life Guide app update

Updating Sihan Chen's [School Life Guide app](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/school-life-guide/id1616558953).

### Musicals @ LCS update

Updating functionality and adding this year's content to the Musicals @ LCS app.

This is a great opportunity to see how an app of significant size and complexity is organized. 

The database schema is something you might not normally otherwise see until second or third year university (although, to be honest, it's not hard once you are talked through it).

### Crop Cataloguer

Spoke with Grayden’s Clark’s dad and came up with this idea after the conversation.

Photos over time of a plot of land – paired with weather conditions on days photographs taken.

Allows a farmer to keep track of crops at various locations over time.

### Mailroom Assistant

An app to scan barcodes and allow the Reception team at LCS to automatically notify LCS community members when a package is waiting for them.

When the package is picked up, the community member just needs to scan the package label and it will be automatically signed out.

Would require cloud syncing, likely with Firebase.

### Check In

An app that scans QR codes printed on the back of LCS keycards.

A faculty member will use the app to check-in students to breakfast in the Dining Hall, and potentially in other locations such as Math Evening Support, the Evening Support Program, Saturday Study, or within groups during Intersession Days.

When the QR code is scanned, information about which student checked-in is sent to a Google Sheet for summarization and follow-up as needed.

### AED Finder

Tells you where, and provides mapping guidance to find, automatic emergency defibrillator devices within the LCS and the broader community.

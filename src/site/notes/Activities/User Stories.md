# User Roles and Stories

## Roles

What kinds of roles will users of your app have?

For example, a mark reporting app might have at least two user roles:

1. Teacher
2. Student

What roles might the app your team is writing have?

## Stories

Each role can be used to write a single sentence that connects to one feature in an app.

For example:

> As a teacher, I need to be able to define a new assessment.
> 
> As a teacher, I want to be able to assign a weight to an assignment.
> 
> As a student, I need to see a list of all assignments I've completed. 

Together with your partner, write as many user stories as you can think of for your app.

## Submission

Add these user stories to a Google doc that is shared by both of you in your Notion portfolio.

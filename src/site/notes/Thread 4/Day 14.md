#### Agenda

1. [Culminating Task: Building an App for an External Audience](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHXEhbi5CYiBmtdE4ryaPH981yRjSV2-/view?usp=share_link)
	- First, please [make a copy of this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fcta3UmM9GBjBJCqf8GtYfGUwUJiy4Ltozio6lMUosg/copy)
		- Then, immediately [submit a link to your interview slides](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6EJOnij6CMttrIHcGdfPuEX69dItoznv8GgtSEe0mY8E2ag/viewform)
		- We will now discuss the prompts in the slide deck, and how to prepare for tomorrow's interview.
		- Here is the order of interviews for tomorrow morning (as generated live in class):
			1. Lewis
			2. Quin
			3. Lawrence
			4. Justin H
			5. Tom
			6. David
			7. Justin W
			8. Morgan
	- Second, one member of your group must generate the final version of your group's directed graph, and [submit the resulting file to this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdjoOsLSdd1vCKs_SLcDzkZjyHq83Nq40-39vmj99jpPM9lwA/viewform).
	> [!NOTE]
	> You will use the `GraphGenerator` app included with the CYOA template project to generate your group's directed graph.
	> 
	> Recall that nodes (pages) must have at least one edge connecting them to other nodes, unless they are an ending node (page).
	> 
	> All nodes (pages) that represent endings *must* be categorized so that your group can produce a directed graph that [has it's endings accurately tallied](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/directed-graph-example.png).
	> 
	> Categorize a node (page) as an ending by populating the `ending_context` and `ending_type_id` column for a given page. 
	> 
	> For example:

	- Third, with any time remaining, ==up until 10 PM this evening==, you and your group members can continue to work on code to improve your group's CYOA app.
		- Remember to use the [[Concepts/Source Control Within a Team\|approach described here to co-ordinate your efforts with source control]].

### Thread 4, Day 4 - Monday, May 27, 2024
#### Agenda

1. [Culminating Task: Building an App for an External Audience](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHXEhbi5CYiBmtdE4ryaPH981yRjSV2-/view?usp=share_link)
	- First, form your groups for the culminating task – maximum of three in a group, please.
		- Groupings *could* be based on shared interests of your partner(s) from Lakefield District Public School, but does not *have* to be.
			- A Choose Your Own Adventure story can be large enough to encompass a variety of interests from your LDPS partners – even if those interests don't overlap.
	- Second, begin planning your narrative using the chart paper and the markers provided.
		- Use a [directed graph](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/joyce-judy.pdf) to make a high-level plan.
		- Use point form to make plans for what happens at each node.
		- Optionally, *one* person in your group may have a computer open to make use of a large language model such as ChatGPT if that helps you to get an idea for an interesting and entertaining narrative.
		- Near the end of class, take clear photographs of the plans you made on paper with your group.
		- Then, hand in your sheet(s) of chart paper to Palmer before you leave class.
			- Be sure each group member's name is written at the top of each page of chart paper.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make a portfolio post [on Notion](https://notion.so), where you:
	- Share the photographs of the plans you made today.
	- Give one-paragraph summary of the story that will be told in your group's Choose Your Own Adventure narrative.

> [!TIP]
> We will return to LDPS tomorrow; you will then continue planning out the narrative with your partners in Mme. Zmozynski's class.

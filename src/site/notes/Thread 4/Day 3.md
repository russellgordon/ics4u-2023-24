### Thread 4, Day 3 - Friday, May 24, 2024
#### Agenda

1. Exemplar: A [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) App
	- What type of features might a CYOA story delivered in app form be able to offer that a book cannot?
2. Discussion: Directed Graphs
	- A look at what a directed graph is formally defined as, and how that can help [organize the data behind a CYOA story](https://www.seanmichaelragan.com/html/%5b2008-03-07%5d_Choose_Your_Own_Adventure_book_as_directed_graph.shtml).
	- Here is an example of a [particularly epic CYOA narrative](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/joyce-judy.pdf) developed by a group from last year's Grade 12 Computer Science class.
	> [!TIP]
	> 
	> In Monday's class, you will organize into groups and begin developing a CYOA narrative on paper.
1. [Culminating Task: Building an App for an External Audience](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHXEhbi5CYiBmtdE4ryaPH981yRjSV2-/view?usp=share_link)
	- Today, we visit Lakefield District Public School for the first time, to meet our partners and [learn more about them and their interests](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/ICS4U_-_App_Development_Partnership_-_Visit_1.pdf).
	- This will help each of you, as the consultants, determine what narrative or theme might work for a Choose Your Own Adventure app built for the students at LDPS, who are your clients.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make a portfolio post [on Notion](https://notion.so), where you:
	- Share clear photographs of the notes you took today.
	- Write a brief summary of what you feel you learned about the interests of your partners at LDPS.

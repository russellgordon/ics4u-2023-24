### Thread 2, Day 5 - Wednesday, January 17, 2024
#### Agenda

1. Activity: [College Board Digital Portfolio](https://digitalportfolio.collegeboard.org/)
	- If you have not already, submit your [[Tasks/AP Create Task\|AP Create Task]].
	  > [!TIP]
	  > A link to a draft of your written responses for the [[Tasks/AP Create Task\|AP Create Task]] must be posted on Notion.
2. Tutorial: [Creating Pie Charts and Donut Charts](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/charts/Building-Pie-Charts-and-Donut-Charts.html)
   - Learn how to create bar charts and line charts using the `Charts` framework and `SwiftUI`.
     > [!TIP]
     > 
     > You can follow this tutorial by creating *either* an iOS or macOS application in Xcode – both work equally well – however, on some computers, macOS projects will compile and run faster.
3. Exercise: Create a Pie or Donut Chart
	- Using what you learned in the tutorial above, select either a pie chart or a donut chart.
	- Create data structures that you can model using the chart type you selected.
	- Then make a chart to visualize the data.
	- For deeper learning, if you have time, make both types of charts using your own data.

### Thread 2, Day 12 - Tuesday, January 30, 2024
#### Agenda

1. Activity: Prototype Demonstrations
	- For teams that have a user they can speak with, today will involve showing your prototype to that user and collecting feedback.
2. Activity: Creating Project Kanban Boards
	- For each project, we will meet as a team and create your Kanban board based on the user stories you wrote and the user feedback you received from prototypes.
	- A [Kanban board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) is a way of organizing project priorities.
	- Here is [one example of a live Kanban board](https://github.com/users/oleeskild/projects/1) for the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin, which is used to build this very website.
3. Working Period: Time to Complete Assigned Project Task(s)

###### Things to do for Evening Study
- You have been assigned an issue from your team's Kanban board; you are to make clear progress on that issue, or complete it if possible.

#### Agenda

1. Activity: [College Board Digital Portfolio](https://digitalportfolio.collegeboard.org/)
	- If you have not already, submit your [[Tasks/AP Create Task\|AP Create Task]].
	  > [!TIP]
	  > It is recommended that you author a draft of your written responses for the [[Tasks/AP Create Task\|AP Create Task]] before submitting your work to the College Board.
2. Recap: [Develop in Swift Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift-tutorials)
	- If you are finished your AP Create Task, this is an opportunity to further consolidate concepts you have learned in the past, and a way to learn a little more about features of Xcode you may not be aware of.
	- Chapters 1, 2, and 3 are all good choices to try.
		> [!NOTE]
		> Mr. Gordon was an unpaid technical reviewer for these tutorials; they were authored by a team at Apple.
###### Things to do before our next class

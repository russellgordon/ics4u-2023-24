### Thread 4, Day 6 - Friday, May 31, 2024
#### Agenda

1. [Culminating Task: Building an App for an External Audience](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHXEhbi5CYiBmtdE4ryaPH981yRjSV2-/view?usp=share_link)
	- Today, your group moves from planning the narrative for your Choose Your Own Adventure story to authoring the narrative.
	- Each group member is required to [make a copy of this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IvQqvnBHZdPMtydnXMWwyL1nCvFrknkekqlEicZ7_R0/copy) and then immediately add a link to their copy of the spreadsheet in their portfolio entry for today on Notion.
	- Work with your group members to assign a range of node ID's to each group member. For example, one member may use the range of id's from 1 to 100, the next from 101 to 200, and so on.
		- So long as node ID's do not overlap, each group member can work in their own spreadsheet to author the narrative.
		- In a future class, the data in these spreadsheets will be imported into a shared database hosted at Supabase.
		- In turn, that database will be used by your group's app.
		> [!TIP]
		> 
		> Optionally, you may use large language model software (ChatGPT, Gemini, et cetera) as a "co-intelligence" for writing. Put another way, do not have the model write the entire story for you, but use it as a creative partner to generate ideas that you flesh out. Have fun with this exercise of creative writing.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Make a portfolio post [on Notion](https://notion.so), where you:
	- Summarize your progress authoring your part of the story.
	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> Be sure you include a link to your copy of the spreadsheet provided above.

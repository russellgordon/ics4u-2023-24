### Thread 1, Day 6 - Thursday, October 26, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Warmup: Defining Custom Shapes
	- Revisit your understanding of how to define custom shapes.
	- Attempt to define a path in the `Arrow` struct so that you can [[Media/Rotating Arrow\|have an app that has this functionality]].
	- First create a new Xcode project named **Rotating Arrow**.
	- Then you can [use this code to get started](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/a81ee78143d2680624f4f6d751068968) – all you need to do is fill in the `Arrow` structure's `path` function.
2. Activity: Generative Art (SwiftUI) – Part 2 of 2
	- Finishing our [[Images/Introduction to Generative Art\|implementation of these rules]] using SwiftUI.
3. Exercise: Create a "Bento-Box" Layout
	- Marketing teams must be able to convey new features in a concise manner to an audience.
	- In recent years, Apple has used "Bento-Box" graphics to do so.
	- Try to [[Media/Bento Box Example\|reproduce this image]] using SwiftUI, or use it as inspiration to design a bento-box themed view related to something you care about.
	- Use SwiftUI Views Mastery as a reference.
	  > [!HINT]
	  > Some keywords to look for examples of:
	  > - foregroundStyle
	  > - cornerRadius
	  > - gradient
	  > - Image
	  >   
	  > **Also:** the keyboard shortcut `Option-Shift-K` produces the Apple logo.
###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Spend time on tasks as needed to demonstrate your understanding of tasks we have recently looked at:
	- sorting algorithms (operations with lists of data)
	- generative art (working with control structures)
	- Magic 8 Ball (building interfaces and using lists in SwiftUI)
	- generative art (in SwiftUI)
	- layout in SwiftUI

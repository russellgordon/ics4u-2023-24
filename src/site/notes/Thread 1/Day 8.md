	- Compare the completed app to the [requirements given for this year's Create Task](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf).
	- Begin generating responses to [last year's prompts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YCKrDj-Ud4qD4EEZFk9MPuER5cS9_im0/view?usp=share_link).
###### Things to do before our next class

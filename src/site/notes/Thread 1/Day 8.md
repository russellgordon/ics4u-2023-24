### Thread 1, Day 8 - Monday, October 30, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Activity: Building a Create Task Exemplar
	- We will build an app that meets requirements for the AP CSP Create Task.
		- [Fork and clone this repository](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/Spelling) to get started.
	- Compare the completed app to the [requirements given](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf).
	- Begin generating responses to [last year's prompts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YCKrDj-Ud4qD4EEZFk9MPuER5cS9_im0/view?usp=share_link).
###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Do your best to author rough written responses to the prompts for last year's AP CSP Create Task based on the exemplar built today.
- [ ] We will then discuss in our next class.

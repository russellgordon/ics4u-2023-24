### Thread 1, Day 1 - Tuesday, October 17, 2023
#### Agenda
1. [Update Operating System](https://teaching.russellgordon.ca/software-setup/mac-os-sonoma/)
	- Update your computer to macOS Sonoma if you have not done so already.
2. Install [[Setup/Xcodes\|Xcodes]]
	- If you do not have this application installed just yet, please install it now.
	- The app makes it easier to manage installation of Xcode versions.
3. Install Xcode 15
	- Use Xcodes to install Xcode 15.
	  > [!TIP]
	  > Do not install Xcode via the App Store, as using this method means that it will automatically get upgraded when a new version is released (which is not always ideal).

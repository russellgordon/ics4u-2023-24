### Thread 1, Day 9 - Tuesday, October 31, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Discussion: [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
	- Solving logical errors and syntax errors can be frustrating, but everyone deals with it, even experienced programmers.
	- Pairing with a friend to describe what you are trying to do with your code, line by line, can be helpful.
		- Often during this process, you will realize the source of the problem you are having.
	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! ðŸ¦†
2. Activity: Building a Create Task Exemplar
	- Finishing [[Media/Spelling\|an app]] that meets requirements for the AP CSP Create Task.

		> You can [view the history of commits](https://github.com/russellgordon/Spelling/commits/main) here.

		> 
		> Have a look at the changes for each commit and that should help you understand how the app was developed.
3. Activity: Authoring Create Task Responses
	- Here are [requirements given for this year's Create Task](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf).
	- Here are [last year's writing prompts](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics4u/AP_Create_Task_2022-23_-_Submission_Requirements.pdf#page=3).
	- We will work together to develop good responses to the prompts.

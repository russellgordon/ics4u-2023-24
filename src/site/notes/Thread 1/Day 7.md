1. Activity: Review your Grade 11 Culminating Task
	- Use time in this class to revisit your culminating task from grade 11 and compare it to the Create Task requirements.

	- In our next class, we will build an exemplar app together in just one period that meets requirements.
###### Things to do before our next class

	- sorting algorithms (operations with lists of data)
	- generative art (working with control structures)
	- Magic 8 Ball (building interfaces and using lists in SwiftUI)
	- generative art (in SwiftUI)
	- layout in SwiftUI

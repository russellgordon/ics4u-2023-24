### Thread 1, Day 4 - Monday, October 23, 2023
#### Agenda
1. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Sharing Long Blocks of Code\|Sharing Long Blocks of Code]]
	- Share code, not screenshots of code.
	- Please continue to use screenshots to show the *results* of code being run.
1. Portfolio: [[Portfolios/Handling Comments on Posts\|Handling Comments on Posts]]
	- Do not mark comments as resolved in Notion so that the record of our conversation is preserved and easy to see at a glance.
1. Discussion: Productive Use of Generative AI
	- Looking at an example of when we might use a large language model to advance learning in this course.
1. Activity: [[Activities/Implementing a Sorting Algorithm\|Implementing a Sorting Algorithm]]
	- Complete this activity to solidify your understanding of core programming concepts (loops and selection statements) and begin to build your understanding of sorting algorithms.
	- Be sure to make a portfolio post on [Notion](https://notion.so) after completing the activity.
1. Activity: [[Activities/Magic 8 Ball\|Magic 8 Ball]] 
	-  Complete this activity to review the implementation of a simple user interface using SwiftUI.

###### Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Spent time on tasks as needed to demonstrate your understanding of tasks we have recently looked at:
	- sorting algorithms (operations with lists of data)
	- generative art (working with control structures)
	- Magic 8 Ball (building interfaces and using lists in SwiftUI)
